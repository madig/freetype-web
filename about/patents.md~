## The TrueType Bytecode Patents Have Expired!

Since May 2010, all patents related to bytecode hinting have expired worldwide.
It it thus no longer necessary to disable the bytecode interpreter, and
starting with FreeType version 2.4, it is enabled by default.

The affected patents were

* [Patent US5155805](http://www.google.com/patents/US5155805): 
Method and apparatus for moving control points in displaying digital typeface
on raster output devices

* [Patent US5159668](http://www.google.com/patents/US5159668): 
Method and apparatus for manipulating outlines in improving digital typeface on
raster output devices

* [Patent US5325479](http://www.google.com/patents/US5325479): 
Method and apparatus for moving control points in displaying digital typeface
on raster output devices

## ClearType Color Filtering Patent Issues

A survey from June 2007 shows no less than nine patents from Microsoft that cover ClearType.

* [Patent US6219025](http://www.google.com/patents/US6219025):
Mapping image data samples to pixel sub-components on a striped display device

* [Patent US6225973](http://www.google.com/patents/US6225973):
Mapping samples of foreground/background color image data to pixel
sub-components

* [Patent US6239783](http://www.google.com/patents/US6239783):
Weighted mapping of image data samples to pixel sub-components on a display
device

* [Patent US6243070](http://www.google.com/patents/US6243070):
Method and apparatus for detecting and reducing color artifacts in images

* [Patent US6282327](http://www.google.com/patents/US6282327):
Maintaining advance widths of existing characters that have been resolution
enhanced

* [Patent US6307566](http://www.google.com/patents/US6307566):
Methods and apparatus for performing image rendering and rasterization
operations

* [Patent US6393145](http://www.google.com/patents/US6393145):
Methods apparatus and data structures for enhancing the resolution of images to
be rendered on patterned display devices

* [Patent US6421054](http://www.google.com/patents/US6421054):
Methods and apparatus for performing grid fitting and hinting operations

* [Patent US6624828](http://www.google.com/patents/US6624828):
Method and apparatus for improving the quality of displayed images through the
use of user reference information

Essentially, these patents cover several different things, which can be grossly sub-divided into

* the process of displaying images where data is 'mapped' to individual (e.g.,
LCD) sub-pixels, instead of whole pixels,

* the process of displaying said images after filtering them for various
purposes, e.g., reducing color fringes, and

* the process of dealing with metrics and spacing rounding in a sub-pixel
world.

It is possible that Microsoft acquired other patents related to the field in
the previous years.

Please note that above claims do not cover the enhanced interpretation of TrueType bytecode instructions as discussed in [Greg Hitchcock's whitepaper][hitchcock2009].

### Patent Claims, Prior Art, and Validity

Steve Gibson claims that the [technique used by ClearType is a reinvention of a
20-years old thing used on the Apple II][gibson]. His exact words are

> Thus, Microsoft's 'ClearType' application of sub-pixel text rendering does
> not represent the dramatic breakthrough that they claim and it can not be
> the valid subject for intellectual property acquisition.

Unfortunately, we believe that Mr. Gibson doesn't understand patent law well.
Under the current US regime, any minor improvement to a previous technique can
be considered an 'invention' and 'protected' by a patent under the right
circumstances (e.g., if it is not totally trivial). If we look at the [first
ClearType related patent mentioned above][us6219025], we see that the [Apple II Wozniak
patent][us4136359] covering this machine's display technique is listed first in the
patents' citations. This shows that both Microsoft and the patent examiner who
granted the patents were aware of this 'prior art'.

We are not trying to defend Microsoft here, just wanting to avoid feeding false
hopes to people who would like to see the patent revoked.

Another popular view is that [these patents are too general to be enforceable][opinion].
Well, to be fair, some of the claims in these patents do indeed use rather
vague descriptive terms (even for a patent lawyer or an 'expert in the field').
This is absolutely not surprising, it is a direct consequence of how the patent
game works.

We won't cover this in greater detail since there are [many interesting pages][interestingpages] on
the subject. However, in case you invalidate a single patent claim (e.g., with
prior art), that doesn't mean the whole patent is busted. Any other independent
and dependent claim can still be enforced.

Some of these patents have up to 40 claims. Invalidating them is going to need
serious prior-art, even if there are also strong chances to invalidate the most
general claims in there. For example, many of the cheap LCD screens on digital
cameras have used a screen where each pixel is either red, green, or blue, with
colour images directly mapped to them; they have been doing it for years, even
when displaying text or menus, and this corresponds exactly to what the most
general claims cover. If we can find a proof that the technique was deployed
before the patent's filing date, we could have valid prior art to bust these.

### Possible Work-Arounds

People have proposed alternatives to the ClearType color filtering method. A
very good example is the [SubLCD][sublcd] technique, which employs a different way to use
sub-pixels compared to Microsoft's ClearType implementation. Its author even
says it doesn't infringe the ClearType patents.

Unfortunately, the FreeType team doesn't share this enthusiasm. The reason is
precisely the very vague patent claims described previously. There is a
non-negligible (even if small) chance that these claims also cover the SubLCD
technique. The situation would probably be different if we could invalidate the
broader patent claims, but this is not the case currently.

### Does FreeType Implement Any of the Patented Techniques?

Technically, no. The patents cover the whole process of generating and
displaying sub-pixel images. Since the font engine doesn't do the display part,
it cannot infringe. Apart from that, FreeType has provided the capability of
converting vector shapes into un-filtered sub-pixel images for a long time.

By default, FreeType's scan-line converter returns 'gray' sub-pixel images,
where for each pixel the color components are equal (this is, R=G=B). The
result is visually identical to gray anti-aliasing and cannot infringe any of
the ClearType patents.

Similarly, the LCD-specific filtering API is disabled by default, which means
that it returns an error and doesn't alter sub-pixel images.

You can override these limitations by activating option
`FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING` in FreeType's `ftoption.h` configuration
file, but you should do that at your own risk.
